# TouchAnalytics
Experimets for TouchAnalytics Data

This project stores the code of my PhD Thesis Project.

My Thesis work is to develop methods to protect behavioral biometric data, in this case touch screen interaction data.
The protection models, cancelable functions, depreciate the performance of the biometric authenticators system.

One of goals is to keep performance and protect biometric data from its disuse. 
Case some data has been theft, my proposal is capable to generate a new protect data based on the biometric sample provided by user.

This project use Weka, Java and MatLab.
